# 👋 Hey, I'm Gerrit Roska
**iOS Engineer | Christ-follower | Building [Ithiel](https://ithiel.co)**  
Shipping SwiftUI apps and building products at the intersection of Faith, AI, and tech

---

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
iOS developer who ships apps. Launched **FlowState** (productivity app) to the App Store in 12 weeks. Currently on Day 43 of 100 Days of SwiftUI, having completed 10+ hands-on iOS projects. 

My background in Business and Christian Ministry means I build products that serve people, not just check feature boxes. I think product-first, then figure out the code.

Currently building **[Ithiel](https://ithiel.co)** — my freelance iOS development business helping entrepreneurs ship MVPs fast.
