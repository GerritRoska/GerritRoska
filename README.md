### 🧠 About Me

I'm a Liberty University grad student passionate about helping people and creating beautiful things that improve, impact and inspire peoples lives.

I recently built the **[ROI Habit Calculator](https://github.com/GerritRoska/ROIHabitCalculator)** — a financial behavior tool that visualizes how small habits (like skipping coffee or fast food) can compound into real wealth.  
It was inspired by a simple idea: _What if investing your $7 a day coffee day could change your future?
